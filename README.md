# Residences
Analyse residential property datasets from:
1) https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/
2) https://data.cso.ie/

The goals are:
1) Clean and combine the data
2) Perform exploratory data analysis
3) Identify outliers - residences that were sold for abnormally high or low prices
4) Forecast future prices
